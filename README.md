# MINDala

MINDala is a VR mindful application for users around the world to co-create a mandala in 7 days.

At the start of each week, the users are revealed to a new mandala template of a unique theme. After 7 days of co-creation, the final mandala artwork will be automatically destroyed.

The application is built in Unity and integrated with Meta Oculus Quest headset.

### Features
What’s unique about this application:
